# CS-5400 Puzzle 1

For your first puzzle assignment, you will be implementing a **random move generator** for this semester's puzzle.

- You can use C, C++, Mono C#, Python 3, JavaScript, Java.
- If you plan to use another language, it should be supported by the CS department's Linux systems. (Please inform me if you are planning to use a language not listed above).

- You should develop, test, and submit your assignments in a matter compatible with the Computer Science Departments's Linux systems, which will be used for grading.

- Programs will be graded (on a scale from 0 to 100) on multiple criteria, of which the most important is correctness. Complete and correct output for every test input case is necessary, but not sufficient, for a full score.
- An auto-grader will be used to help the graders during the grading process. Therefore it is of supreme importance that you comply with the assignment's input and output format.

- When your assignment is complete and ready, modify the content of the included `ReadyForGrading.txt` file to `Yes`. Also include the language you are programming in within the `ReadyForGrading.txt` file as well.
- When including your langauge, write the langauge in **all lower case** with no version numbers (python will be assumed to be python3).
- This is how you will indicate to the graders that your assignment is ready to be graded.

- Please make sure you have a working `run.sh` script before submitting.
